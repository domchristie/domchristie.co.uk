    <p>This infographic, highlighting quirks of the UK voting system, recently popped up in my Twitter feed. Whilst the accompanying article makes some valid points, the graphic is rather inaccurate.</p>

<div>
<a href="http://domchristie.s3.amazonaws.com/may2015-votes-seats-original.png"><img src="http://domchristie.s3.amazonaws.com/may2015-votes-seats-original.png" alt="Infographic of forecast votes-to-seats for Ukip, Lib Dems, Greens, and SNP"></a>
<div class="caption"><small>Data Visualisation taken from <a href="http://may2015.com/featured/would-you-like-5-million-votes-and-4-seats-or-1-million-votes-and-56-seats/">May2015: Would you like 5 million votes and 4 seats, or 1 million votes and 56 seats?</a></small></div>
</div>

<p>Firstly, it uses circles (of two dimensions) to represent one-dimensional data. Edward Tufte discusses this in The Visual Display of Quantitative Information:</p>

<blockquote><p>There are considerable ambiguities in how people perceive a two-dimensional surface and then convert that perception into a one-dimensional number. Changes in physical area on the surface of a graphic do not reliably produce appropriately proportional changes in perceived areas.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this instance, the designer has varied the radius/diameter of the circles, which results in a surface area that exaggerates the data. For example, compare the circles for the Green Party and the SNP. If the Green Party circle represents 1 unit-squared, then you&#x2019;d expect the SNP&#x2019;s circle to be 56 units-squared. Instead, it is 3136 units-squared&#x2014;56-times greater than it should be.</p>

<p>Secondly, it encourages comparisons between values on different scales: percentage of votes, and number of seats.</p>

<p>The graphic gives the impression that the Lib Dems <strong>gain</strong> considerably from the voting system: 8% votes &#x2192; 26 seats. 26 seats actually represents just 4% of the total seats (650), so their votes are <strong>effectively halved</strong>! This distortion is also observed when comparing the Lib Dems&#x2019; &#x201C;votes&#x201D; circle to the SNP&#x2019;s &#x201C;seats&#x201D; circle. The SNP&#x2019;s 56 seats (8.61%) should be comparable to the Lib Dems votes (8%). It isn&#x2019;t.</p>

<div class="caption"><small>Annotated graphic highlighting distortions. The dark blue circle shows how big the SNP&#x2019;s circle would be if areas were proportionate.</small></div>
</div>

<p>What&#x2019;s more, there is a second graphic (not re-published here), making the same votes-to-seats comparisons but with the Labour, Conservative, and Ukip parties. However, this is on a different scale to the previous one, making any further comparisons impossible.</p>

<p>It would be more accurate to make comparisons based on percentages of seats, and include all the data in a single graphic. Perhaps a simple table would suffice?</p>

<p>The following table attempts to convey how much each party is set to gain/lose because of the voting system based on the forecast. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that a party gains from the system; ratio less than 1 indicates that a party loses from the system.</p>

<table>

<p>Ratios can be transformed into &#x201C;Advantages&#x201D; by taking logarithms: positive values indicate gain, negative values indicate loss.</p>

<p>From these tables we can deduce that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Labour and the Conservatives are set to gain a little from the voting system</li>
  <li>The SNP would gain as much proportionally as the Lib Dems lose: the voting system effectively doubles the SNP&#x2019;s seats, and halves the Lib Dems&#x2019;</li>
  <li>Ukip and the Greens are set to lose out the most, significantly more than any other loses or gains</li>
</ul>
