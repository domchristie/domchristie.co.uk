    <blockquote>
  <p>The process of simplification is design 101, a mind-set that every design student is taught in school. But not every design student adopts it, and rarely it&#x2019;s applied with the ruthless discipline practiced by Jony [Ive]. Indeed, if there&#x2019;s such a thing as a single secret to what Jony Ive does, it is to follow slavishly the simplification philosophy. That approach has accounted for many of the major breakthroughs, as well as some projects that failed and others that Apple hasn&#x2019;t released. Caring enough to commit the enormous time and effort to get something right has also been Jony&#x2019;s hallmark, from his earliest college projects onward.</p>
