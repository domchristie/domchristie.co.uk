    <p>I had a reputation at university for being rather slow at writing essays. I&apos;d labour over every sentence, making sure it was clear and concise and the best it could possibly be before moving on to the next one. As you can imagine, when you&apos;ve got thousands of words to write, this process doesn&apos;t work very well.</p>
<p>This attention to detail still manifests itself in the work I do everyday, and it can be painful (believe it or not, this sentence is the product of many iterations!); but I have some thoughts, and bizarrely enough, I miss writing them down. So I will start.</p>
<p>That&apos;s all for now, though. It&apos;s taken me long enough.</p>
