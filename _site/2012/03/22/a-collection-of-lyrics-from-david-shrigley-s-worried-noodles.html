    <p>In anticipation of my visit to the <a href="http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/hayward-gallery-and-visual-arts/other-art-on-site/tickets/david-shrigley-brain-activity-61752">David Shrigley exhibition at the Hayward</a>, here are a collection of my favourite lyrics from his record, &apos;Worried Noodles&apos;. Lyrics found on <a href="http://www.moorestevie.com/3/shriglyrics2.html">moorestevie.com</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/1uSd8tqGADIgDaUwkjL8FD">A Truce (music by Max Tundra)</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I&apos;d like to declare a truce.
<br>&#x2014;What&apos;s a truce?
<br>It&apos;s when you agree to stop fighting.
<br>&#x2014;Have we been fighting?
<br>Yes.
<br>&#x2014;Are you sure?
<br>Yes.
<br>&#x2014;When were we fighting?
<br>Just now down there on that plastic mat.
<br>&#x2014;We weren&apos;t fighting, we were playing &apos;Twister&apos;
<br>Are you sure we weren&apos;t fighting?
<br>&#x2014;Yes. Twister is a game.
<br>A fighting game?
<br>&#x2014;No, just an ordinary game.
<br>For soldiers?
<br>&#x2014;No, well, soldiers can play but there is no fighting.
<br>Soldiers love to fight.
<br>&#x2014;Well, there is no fighting when you&apos;re playing &apos;Twister&apos;. It&apos;s against the rules.
<br>There are rules?
<br>&#x2014;Yes, didn&apos;t you know? We&apos;ve been playing for hours. Didn&apos;t you realise?
<br>No. I thought we were fighting.</p>

<h2><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/439Bflxiqly3ChqMNd3kk0">The Wooden Floor (music by James Chadwick)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The wooden floor is made of wood
<br>And the wood is very good
<br>Oak, we think
<br>The wooden floor is full of grace
<br>And beneath the floor there is a space
<br>Where dirt and bits of stuff reside
<br>And recently, at their side,
<br>A human head
<br>The human head belonged to Pete
<br>Who scuffed the floor
<br>With his giant feet.</p>

<p>He will not be doing that again
<br>Unless his corpse grows a new head
<br>And comes back to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6hhoi7APEciPVyyzUsfkAv">Squirrel (music by Munch Munch)</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Squirrel squirrel
<br>In the tree
<br>Do me a favour
<br>Collect Nuts for me
<br>Do me a favour
<br>And take the shells off
<br>The nuts
<br>And examine them closely
<br>To check they are not
<br>Rotten
<br>Before you give them to me.</p>

<p>Nut Nut
<br>Beautiful nut
<br>Salt nut
<br>Spicy nut
<br>You&apos;rea good old nut
<br>And I love you.</p>
</blockquote>

<br>No no no no no no no no
<br>No eyes
<br>No no no no no no no no
<br>No teeth
<br>No no no no no no no no
