I am a software designer/developer, who works mainly on web applications. I previously studied Music and Sound Recording at Surrey University, and spent a year working as a runner / assistant engineer at Abbey Road Studios.

I like good coffee, typography, electronic music, photography (with film), and gardening.

When I was a lot younger, my favourite things were Lego, dinosaurs, and Roman history.

I was born in Denmark, and spent a couple of years in Canada, but moved to the UK when I was about 3 years old. Whilst I like to think I'm Danish, I'm actually very British.
