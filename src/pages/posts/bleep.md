Interesting to hear the origin of bleeping or editing-out offensive words on the radio, and how it's done technically; [Bleep!](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/bleep/) from 99% Invisible also discusses the ethics of censorship and the subtle differences between bleeping-out, editing-out, or leaving in.
