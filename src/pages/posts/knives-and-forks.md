<p>I remember my friend (and housemate at the time), Julian, had his own method for dealing with this situation. He&#x2019;d put on some really glitchy fast electronica (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=BxEb2FrQUbE#t=180">Squarepusher</a> perhaps?), and blitz it as fast as he could. Seemed to do the job, and it&#x2019;s a method I often employ to get stuff done. My track of choice? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNOzJTIklBw">Milanese - Mr. Bad News (Clark Remix)</a> (NSFW).</p>
