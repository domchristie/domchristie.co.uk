I have been experimenting with the History API, working out a way to determine the direction of a `popstate` event. `popstate` is dispatched when navigating Back and Forward, and there's no direction information in the event. However, reading [Astro's View Transition code](https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/fca6892f8d6a30ceb1e04213be2414dd4cb4d389/packages/astro/components/ViewTransitions.astro#L433), I noticed that [Matthew Phillips](https://github.com/matthewp) had implemented this by storing an index in the History state, and keeping track of the current index on `history.pushState`. The direction can be then determined by comparing the current index with the index from the popstate event.

What was most surprising was the following:

```js
if (history.state) {
  // we reloaded a page with history state
  // (e.g. history navigation from non-transition page or browser reload)
  // â€¦
}
```

It turns out that the History state is persisted between page refreshes:

```js
history.state // null
history.pushState({ index: 1 }, null)
history.state.index // 1
location.reload()
history.state.index // 1
```
