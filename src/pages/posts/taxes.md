<p>I've been meaning to get this quotation down for ages. I heard it on Radio 4's Chain Reaction programme back in September last year, when Kevin Eldon interviewed Mark Steel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think lampposts soon will have little meters on, and you'll put 5p in and it'll give you just enough light to get to the next one: &quot;Why should I pay for someone else's light? I'M INDOORS!&#x2026; bloody fire-brigade &#x2014; I'm not on fire! I'll pay when I want carrying over someones shoulder down a smoky bannister!&quot;</p>

<p>These are the sort of people that go: &quot;What about guide dogs? All the money that gets spent on them! I can't climb a tree, nobody buys me a gibbon!&quot;</p>
<cite>Mark Steel, on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013gfnh">Chain Reaction</a></cite>
