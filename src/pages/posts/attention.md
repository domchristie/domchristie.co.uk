<blockquote><p>The gift of attention is perhaps the most valuable. Attention may seem like an easy gift to give, but it is not; it is the scarcest resource available because its quantities are limited and nonrenewable. We can&#x2019;t produce more attention, and there are ever more things vying for it each day.</p><cite>Frank Chimero <span class="byline lower">in</span> <a href="http://read.shapeofdesignbook.com/chapter10.html">The Shape of Design</a></cite></blockquote>
