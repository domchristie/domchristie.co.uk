Computers and their affiliated apparatus can do powerful things graphically, in part by turning out the hundreds of plots necessary for good data analysis. But at least a few computer graphics only evoke the response &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t it remarkable that the computer can be programmed to draw like that?&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;My, what interesting data.&#x201D;</p><cite>Edward Tufte <span class="lower byline">in</span> The Visual Display of Quantitative Data</cite></blockquote>
