<p>When I first set up domchristie.co.uk (~2005), I used to update it with what I was reading, watching, taking photos of, and listening to. Given that most the music I listen to is tracked by Last.fm, I thought I&#x2019;d set up a page that displays this in a nice way.</p>

<p><a href="http://scrobbles.domchristie.co.uk/">Scrobbles</a> displays the 200 most recently listened to tracks, grouped by album. Click on an album cover to hear the most played track from that album (this can be a bit unpredictable!).</p>

<p>Scrobbles was built with the Last.fm API and <a href="http://toma.hk">Tomahawk</a>.</p>
