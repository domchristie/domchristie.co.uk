<p>I've been pretty busy recently working on a new side-project: a nice bookmarking/scrapbooking tool, which gives me the chance to delve deeper into both server-side and front-end technologies. It's being built in Rails 3.1 and Backbone (with CoffeeScript), and includes plenty of pretty CSS bits (webfonts, transitions etc). It'll hopefully have a bookmarklet, and a decent API &#x2026; we'll see.</p>

<p>There's also been some activity on my open source projects, which is amazing. <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/to-markdown">to-markdown</a> has had some important updates (and has gained a few followers along the way!). Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/bergie">Henri Bergius</a>, it now runs on Node.js (another technology I need to get properly stuck into). <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/ios-placeholder">ios-placeholder</a> has been updated thanks to <a href="https://github.com/theinterned">Ned Schwartz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/juration">juration</a> will be getting the 'chrono' format support soon (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jotto">Jonathan Otto</a>). Hopefully I'll get these pull requests merged in soon: my head has been stuck in that little side-project of mine!</p>

<p>In other news, I'm giving <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a> a go (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/samoli">Sam</a> has not stopped going on about it!). I'm getting into it, thanks to <a href="http://opensoul.org/blog/archives/2012/01/12/getting-started-with-sublime-text-2/">this Sublime Text 2 guide</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/sublimetips">@sublimetips</a> twitter feed. One essential package for those who regularly deal with <code>erb</code> views: <a href="https://github.com/eddorre/SublimeERB">SublimeERB</a> (available via Package Control, but don't forget to add the key bindings, as detailed in the readme).</p>
