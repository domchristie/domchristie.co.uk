I can't help but feel a little disappointed by the new [Ruby on Rails site](https://rubyonrails.org/) launched last year. It's undoubtedly more up-to-date, but gone is the emphasis on fun and friendliness, and in its place, a focus on business and making money.

Aside from the removal of the happy handdrawn cartoons, the contrast in copy is revealing. Where previously it opened with:

> **_Imagine_ what you could build** â€¦\
> Learning to build a modern web application is daunting. Ruby on Rails makes it much **easier and more fun**. It includes everything you need to **build fantastic applications**, and you can learn it with the support of our large, **friendly community**

(Emphasis my own.) It now reads:

> **Compress the complexity of modern web apps.**\
> Learn just what you need to get started, then keep leveling up as you go. Ruby on Rails scales from HELLO WORLD to **IPO** â€¦
>
> Over the past two decades, Rails has taken countless companies to millions of users and **billions in market valuations**.

**Happiness** does get a mention, but sadly it's the last thing mentioned, and feels lost amongst the business spiel.

For Rails apps themselves, the start up graphic has also been removed and I will certainly miss this happy scene ðŸ¥²
