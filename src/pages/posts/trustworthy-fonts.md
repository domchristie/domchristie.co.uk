<p>I'm currently reading <a href="http://www.simongarfield.com/pages/books/just_my_type.htm">Just My Type</a> by Simon Garfield. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Just-My-Type-About-Fonts/dp/1846683025/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327262320&amp;sr=8-1">Buy it</a>: it's very good and has some nice little nuggets, like this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We tend to treat the traditional and familiar as trustworthy. We are dubious of fonts that alert us to their difference, or fonts that seem to be trying too hard. We don't like being consciously sold things or paying for fancy design we don't need.</p>
<cite>Simon Garfield, in <a href="http://www.simongarfield.com/pages/books/just_my_type.htm">Just My Type</a></cite>
