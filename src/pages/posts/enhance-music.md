[Enhance Music](https://begin.com/blog/posts/2023-09-28-introducing-enhance-music) is a clever demonstration of a progressively enhanced music player. The fallback uses links to navigate an `iframe` player bar which includes an `autoplay` `audio` element. It is enhanced with a custom JavaScript-based player that persists between page loads. A great example of [lateral thinking with withered technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology).
