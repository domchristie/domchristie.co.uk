<p>Absolutely love these pieces by David Shrigley for <a href="https://www.sketch.uk.com/David_Shrigley_intro.php">Soho&#x2019;s Sketch restaurant</a>. Seen in <a href="http://www.cityam.com/1403547146/david-shrigley-sketch-fourth-plinth">an interview with Shrigley</a> in City A.M&#x2019;s Bespoke magazine.</p>
