Ruby's `|=` operator: appends values to the array that don't already exist.

```rb
a = [1]
a |= [2] # a == [1, 2]
a |= [2] # a == [1, 2]
```

`irb` accepts an `-r` option to automatically require gems:

```
irb -r down
```

```rb
tempfile = Down.download("http://example.com") # look! no require!
```

[Ruby on Rails' `missing`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods/WhereChain.html#method-i-missing) fetches records that do not have an associated record. For example A `Post` that does not have any associated `Comment`s:

```rb
Post.where.missing(:comments)
```
