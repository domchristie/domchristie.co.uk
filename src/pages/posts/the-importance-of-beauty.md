<blockquote><p>Beauty is essential. It is never a trade-off. Make the most of beauty and never sacrifice it at the altar of expediency. It is too high a price.</p>
<p>Add nothing ugly. Do not accept any existing ugliness as fixed. Remove and change it if possible, otherwise modify or screen it.</p>
<cite>Monty Don <span class="byline lower">in</span> Down to Earth, p.32</cite>
