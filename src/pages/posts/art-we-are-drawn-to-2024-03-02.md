<blockquote><p>[T]he art that people are drawn to - at an individual and collective level - reflects much about what is missing from their lives. The particular register of emotions we're sensitive to in the visual sphere hints at what we long for, but don't reliably have a connection to, in ourselves.</p><cite>The Good Enough Parent 2021, p.83</cite></blockquote>
