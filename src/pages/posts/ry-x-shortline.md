<p>Really enjoying this from RY X. I first heard the title track from his EP, Berlin, on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2DdtkDK7w0">a recent Sony TV advert</a>. As it turns out, RY X is signed to Dumont Dumont, a label started by Magnus Bohman, who co-founded Imperial Recordings. Imperial&#x2019;s first signing was Jos&#xE9; Gonz&#xE1;lez, who also had a track used on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zOrV-5vh1A">a Sony TV advert back in 2006</a>. Coincidence?</p>

<p>(Contains nudity, flashing lights, and a great synth line&#x2014;which unfortunately isn&#x2019;t on the record.)</p>
