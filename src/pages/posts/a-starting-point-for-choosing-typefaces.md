<p>This is a brief follow up to something I mentioned in <a href="http://domchristie.co.uk/posts/42">my previous post about Helvetica</a> (and the film). I wrote that choosing a typefaces requires careful consideration. Aral Balkan's recent article <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/notes/design-is-not-veneer/">Design is not veneer</a> expresses this perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the very least, you should be asking &#x2018;why?&#x2019; Why this font? What is the feeling I&#x2019;m trying to convey? Is this text meant to be serious, fun, exciting, solemn, scary? What&#x2019;s the voice I&#x2019;m trying to achieve? And for whom? Who is my audience? Whom am I designing for?</p>
