Piet Mondrian's "Composition with Lines" (1917) is one of my favourite artworks, and in searching for a print online, I came across the art of [Professor A. Michael Noll](http://noll.uscannenberg.org/).

Noll pioneered generative digital art in the 1960s, and in one of his experiments he [digitally recreated "Composition with Lines"](http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/Mondrian.pdf). Participants where asked whether they could determine the computer-generated version from the original, and which version they preferred. Only 28% were able to correctly identify the computer generated version, and 59% actually preferred it.

This led me to more of Noll's work, and I was drawn to his early experiments drawing patterns programmed with Fortran. I particularly like this note:

<blockquote><p>"Pattern Seven" was supposed to have been a series of randomly-placed prolate cycloids but apparently something went amiss.</p><cite><a href="http://noll.uscannenberg.org/Art%20Papers/BTL%201962%20Memo.pdf">Patterns by 7090</a></cite></blockquote>

In his paper, Noll outlines the algorithm used to create Pattern Two (below), and I thought it'd be fun to replicate it on the web.

… and here's my replica:

Thankfully I didn't have to set up and CRT or a 35mm film camera (although perhaps that would've been fun?!) but there was a bit of wrangling to get it looking right. Perhaps I could run an experiment to see which people prefer?
