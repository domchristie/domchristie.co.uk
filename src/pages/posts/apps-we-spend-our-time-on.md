<blockquote><p>If all you ever eat is the factory-farmed fast food, you are not going to feel good. The things we remember in our lives are those great meals we had, surrounded by people we love, <em>made</em> by people who love us, that was a cuisine that was part of our community, or part of our culture, part of our tradition.</p><p>The same thing could be true of the web we spend our time on; what if an app or site that we use every day, was made by somebody we know that we love, that's part of a community that we're a part of, was <em>made by people we can name</em>? How many apps on your phone were made by somebody you know who made it? Not enough.</p><cite>Anil Dash on <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2022/11/18/ep-362">The Talk Show</a></cite></blockquote>
