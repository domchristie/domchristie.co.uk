Rails' [`Array#inquiry`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Array.html#method-i-inquiry) makes checking string-like arrays easier (via Kasper Timm Hansen):

```rb
# instead of:
parts = [:feed, :description, :play, :play_later]
parts.include?(:description)

# with `inquiry`:
parts = [:feed, :description, :play, :play_later].inquiry
parts.description?
```

Rails' [`truncate`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper.html#method-i-truncate) helper accepts a block which is captured and displayed when the contents is truncated. (via [Matt Swanson on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/1356041464078364679.))
