<p>My new thing is to listen to Danish radio in the morning in the hope that it will improve my Danish language listening skills. At the moment I can only pick up the odd word in each sentence, but there was an interview (in English) with Prem Rawat that caught my ear, which included this:</p>

<blockquote><p>I think we are really out of touch with ourselves. We&#x2019;re in touch with everything else: this account, and that account, and our phones. Things that were supposed to <em>save us us time</em> may or may not save time, but they definitely <em>occupy that free time</em> we were promised.</p>

<p>This reminded me of something Mark Steel said when he was on The Infinite Monkey Cage show. He reckoned that the problems lie with the &#x201C;social mechanisms&#x201D; that employ the science, rather than the science itself:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the early 1970s, there were two things that we were promised &#x2026; One was that space travel would go on and on, and by now we&#x2019;d <em>certainly</em> be on Mars. But the other thing was that new technology would mean that we would have this crisis of having <em>so much leisure</em>, because <em>everything</em> would done by machinery &#x2026; what on earth do we do with all the time? As we know, the average working week now in Britain is longer than it was back then.</p>
