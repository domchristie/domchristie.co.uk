# domchristie.co.uk

The [Astro](https://astro.build/) project behind [domchristie.co.uk](https://domchristie.co.uk/). It's built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and the [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/) approach, using [tailwind-utopia](https://github.com/domchristie/tailwind-utopia).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

You'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ posts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ posts
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ â€¦
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

- `src/pages/index.astro` is the homepage, listing the most recent posts: short posts are displayed in full, longer ones link to the full post page
- `src/pages/posts/index.astro` lists each post grouped by year, and links to the full post page
- `src/posts.js` provides functions for querying posts and their content

Any static assets, like images, are placed in the `public/` directory.

## Customizations

To avoid awkward relative import referencing, aliases are set up in `tsconfig.json`:

- `src/components/` is aliased to `$components/`
- `src/layouts/` is aliased to `$layouts/`
- `src/utils/` is aliased to `$utils/`

This helps with setting default layouts. To avoid having to set a layout in every file, `astro.config.mjs` includes a remark plugin to automatically set `frontmatter.layout` depending on where the file exists, for example:

- `src/pages/about.md` will have a `frontmatter.layout` of `$layouts/Pages.astro`
- `src/pages/posts/hello-world.md` will have a `frontmatter.layout` of `$layouts/Posts.astro`

This can be overridden in the file's frontmatter.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
