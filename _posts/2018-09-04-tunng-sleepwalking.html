<blockquote><p>This is a song about how we create the world and the world creates us in turn.</p>

<p>Our brains construct an experience of the world around us, filtered through our own personal expectations and subconscious desires and beliefs. To a certain extent, who we think we are is an illusion and everyone who knows us, including ourselves, is experiencing someone quite different. Perhaps our subconscious world of dreams and sleepwalking is closer to the real us than our waking imaginations!</p>

<p>This song is about trying to navigate our experience of the world, trying to figure out what&apos;s real and what&apos;s not, and making the best of what comes our way.</p>
