<p>I can&apos;t tell you how many times I&apos;ve mistakenly sent an email before adding the attachments; so I was pleased to see this pop up (apparently this was previously a Gmail labs feature). However, as <a href="https://twitter.com/auxilit">a colleague</a> pointed out, wouldn&apos;t it be nice if the message accompanied a file browser (rather than just a confirm dialog)?</p>
