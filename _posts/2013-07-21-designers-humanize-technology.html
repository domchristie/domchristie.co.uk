<blockquote><p>Simply, designers humanize technology. Designers are trained to embrace chaos and complexity, to hold multiple and often competing ideas in their heads at one time, to be flexible and nimble in the face of changing constraints, and most importantly, to visualize concepts, systems and services that don&apos;t yet exist. Designers tell stories about how the future ought to be.</p><cite>Jon Kolko <span class="lower byline">in</span> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-kolko/design-liberal-art_b_2427295.html">Now Hiring: The Most Liberal Art</a></cite></blockquote>
