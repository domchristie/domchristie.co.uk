<blockquote>
<p>London is such a constantly evolving city. It has many layers of systems in place, but nothing really quite works.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re working in an environment which doesn&apos;t necessarily work very well, it&apos;s a great environment to try and make things work well. We need contrast and tension to be able to create.</p>
