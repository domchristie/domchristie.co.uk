<p style="margin-top: -1em;"><small>No, you&apos;re not at the opticians. Lato (L), Calluna Sans(R).</small></p>

<p>I really like <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lato">Lato</a>. It was the typeface I used for headings on this site. That was until I fancied a change and discovered <span class="tk-calluna" style="font-style: italic">Calluna</span> and <span class="tk-calluna-sans">Calluna Sans</span>.</p>

<p>I prefer straightness of the leg on Calluna Sans&apos; uppercase <span class="tk-calluna-sans">R</span>, and the way the uppercase <span class="tk-calluna-sans">J</span> drops below the baseline. The uppercase <span class="tk-calluna-sans">M</span> nearly put me off: I usually prefer vertical stems to sloped, but the apex (in the middle) is cleaner than that belonging to Lato, and overall it appears less imposing.</p>
