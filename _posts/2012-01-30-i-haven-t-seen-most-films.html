<p>For whatever reasons, going to the cinema/watching films has never been something I've done much of. It's not that I don't enjoy it, but I've often felt that a cinema visit isn't worth it (a feeling that was reinforced when I was invited to watch Meet the Fockers<sup><a id="r14.1" href="#fn14.1">[1]</a></sup>).</p>

<p>I often found it rather embarrassing to admit I hadn't seen an absolute classic. Now I'm quite open about the fact that I haven't seen most films (or rather, I haven't seen most of the films that almost everyone I know has seen). It's even become an interesting conversation starter: people are amazed when I reel off some of the films I've yet to see (just you wait!).</p>

<p>It also sparked off an idea amongst friends to create a documentary about me watching classic films. It was a rather ambitious New Year's resolution, that we started but never finished.</p>

<h2>Films I Haven't Seen</h2>
