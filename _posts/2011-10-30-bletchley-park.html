<p>The BBC are currently running a series on some of the untold stories of World War II. The first was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016ltm0">Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park&apos;s Lost Heroes</a>, and told the story of how one of the most sophisticated codes was broken (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_cipher">Lorenz</a>), which led to the invention of the first computer. It&apos;s a great watch.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve visted Bletchley Park a couple of times. It&apos;s a fascinating place, pretty much untouched since the war and well worth a visit.</p>
