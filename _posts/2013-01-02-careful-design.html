<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes we want to capture people&#x2019;s attention at a glance to communicate something fast. At other times we want to have the interface fade away into the background, letting people paint pictures in their minds with our words&#x2026;</p>

<p>I tend to distinguish between these two broad objectives as designing for impact on the one hand, and designing for immersion on the other. What defines them is interruption. Impact needs an attention-grabbing interruption. Immersion requires us to remove interruption from the interface. Careful design <em>deliberately</em> interrupts but doesn&#x2019;t <em>accidentally</em> disrupt.</p>
