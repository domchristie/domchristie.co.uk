<p>Another quotation from E.F. Schumacher, this time taken from a BBC Radio 4 programme <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079njxm">Is Small the Next Big?</a> His book, Small is Beautiful (Economics as if People Mattered), is jam-packed full of interesting ideas, and highly recommended.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s quite astonishing how many people are asking, &#x201C;what can I do to save the world?&#x2014;I am so small!&#x201D; &#x2026; Everything new starts very, very small, normally in a very dark place.</p><cite>E.F. Schumacher <span class="byline lower">from</span> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079njxm">Is Small the Next Big?</a></cite></blockquote>
