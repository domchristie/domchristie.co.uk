<p>I&#x2019;m sure this won&#x2019;t be the last time I mention Frank Chimero&#x2019;s recent article, The Inferno of Independence; there are so many good parts, but here is just a snippet. It&#x2019;s something I wanted to get across in <a href="http://blog.makeshift.io/post/62992606692/why-hack-an-interview-with-dom-christie">my Why Hack? interview</a>, but it&#x2019;s articulated a lot better below:</p>

<blockquote><p>The technology that matters only tries to change things by giving us more of what we&#x2019;ve always wanted: autonomy, access, and community.</p><cite>Frank Chimero <span class="byline lower">in</span> <a href="http://frankchimero.com/blog/2013/09/the-inferno-of-independence/">The Inferno of Independence</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>&#x201C;Autonomy, access, and community.&#x201D; Nailed it.</p>
