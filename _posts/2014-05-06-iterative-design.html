<blockquote><p>The design process is actually a big spiral you go through. You start exploring ideas only to come back to explore the original idea. To outsiders, it might seem like you&#x2019;re going through circles, chasing your tail. But each time you go through these circles you get closer and closer to where all these things align. It&#x2019;s a spiral&#x2014;a fractal spiral that never ends, and the closer you get to the point where everything aligns, the more you discover, the more you realize you have to zoom in again and keep on building it. This is true for anything that can be designed. Anything can be iterated endlessly to make it better and better.</p><cite>Marcos Weskamp, Head Designer at Flipboard, in an  <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3017867/most-creative-people/how-flipboards-head-designer-grapples-with-the-webs-manic-pace-of-chang">interview with Fast Company</a></cite></blockquote>
