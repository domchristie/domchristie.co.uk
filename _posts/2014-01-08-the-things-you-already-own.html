<blockquote><p>If I had a billion dollars to fund a marketing campaign, I would launch a campaign on behalf of things you already own: <em>Why not enjoy them today?</em> Because we all have so many things that are just around&#x2014;they&#x2019;re in the closet, they&#x2019;re in the attic, whatever&#x2014;that we don&#x2019;t even think about anymore because there isn&#x2019;t enough room left in our brains because we are so busy processing all the exciting new developments.</p><p>At the end of the day, when you&#x2019;re looking around at the objects in your house and you&#x2019;re deciding what really has value&#x2026; they&#x2019;re going to be the things that have some meaning in your life.</p><cite>Rob Walker, New York Times columnist, in <a href="http://www.objectifiedfilm.com/">Objectified</a></cite></blockquote>
