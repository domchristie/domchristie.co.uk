<p>I&apos;ve been pretty busy recently on a couple of small projects. As the name suggests, <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/ios-placeholder">iOS Placeholder</a> is a jQuery plugin that emulates the iOS behaviour of placeholder text in the browser. It&apos;s inspired by Robert Nyman&apos;s ideas <a href="https://robertnyman.com/2011/05/02/html5-placeholder-and-an-alternative-approach-introducing-roberts-playground/">on placeholder text behaviour</a>, and offers clearer labelling of input fields once they are in focus.</p>
<p>The second project, <a href="https://github.com/domchristie/juration">Juration</a>, is a simple time range parser/humanizer, inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/chronic/">chronic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hpoydar/chronic_duration">chronic_duration</a> Ruby gems. Parsing takes a duration in words (e.g. 3mins 50secs) and returns that value in seconds. Stringifying does the inverse - taking a value in seconds and converting it to words. Feel free to have a play on the <a href="https://domchristie.github.com/juration">Juration demo page</a>.</p>
