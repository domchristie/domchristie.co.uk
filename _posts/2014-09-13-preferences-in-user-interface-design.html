<p>Jef Raskin on &#x201C;Modes, User-Preference Settings, and Temporary Modes&#x201D;, in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Humane-Interface-Directions-Interactive/dp/0201379376">The Humane Interface</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facilities for setting user preferences constitute an example of modes and are a major source of frustration. Ironically, these features are usually touted as a benefit. Present user interfaces are often so difficult to use that a user may feel an urge to rearrange them. Microsoft specifically recommends that such facilities be provided: &#x201C;Users, because of their widely varying skills and preferences, must be able to personalize aspects of their interface &#x2026; such as color, fonts, or other options.&#x201D; [from Microsoft&#x2019;s Windows Interface Guidelines, 1995] </p>
<p>&#x2026; By providing preferences, we burden users with a task extraneous to their job function. &#x2026; <em>Time spent in learning and operating the personalization features is time mostly wasted from the task at hand</em>.</p><p>&#x2026; Customization sounds nice, democratic, open-ended, and full of freedom and joy for the user, but I am unaware of any studies that show that it increases productivity or improves <em>objective</em> measures of usability or learnability. Adding customization certainly makes a system more complex and more difficult to learn. I suspect that if you were to take a user survey, more people than not would be in favor of lots of personalizable features &#x2026; [but as] has been observed in a number of experiments, <em>an interface that optimizes productivity is not necessarily an interface that optimises subjective ratings</em>.&#x201D;</p>
