<blockquote>
<p>It might sound funny, but I&#x2019;m not a very ambitious person. When it comes to software and products, I have a very low bar in terms of ambition level. I feel like there is so much stuff that is so poor, where the things you have to do to improve, just have to be just a little bit better.</p>
