<blockquote><p>Overload, clutter, and confusion are not attributes of information, they are failures of design. So if something is cluttered, fix your design, don&apos;t throw out information. If something is confusing, don&apos;t blame your victim&#x2014;the audience&#x2014;instead, fix the design. And if the numbers are boring, get better numbers</p><cite>Edward Tufte <span class="lower byline">in</span> <a href="http://adage.com/article/adagestat/edward-tufte-adagestat-q-a/230884/">The AdAgeStat Q&amp;A</a></cite></blockquote>
