<p>In March, I listened to music from Japan. I&apos;d just bought Shigeto&apos;s excellent <a title="Lineage Release on Ghostly Site" href="http://ghostly.com/releases/lineage-ep">Lineage</a> (and got <a href="http://www.theghostlystore.com/collections/clothing/products/lineage-tee">the t-shirt</a>), so I felt it was a suitable time to investigate music from other Japanese artists.</p>

<p>I plugged in &quot;Takagi Masakatsu&quot; into Last.fm (an artist I discovered from my <a title="FatCat playlist on Spotify" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/bonanza9/playlist/0ZRuMeKCRaBkfkxv8yXh43">FatCat inspired month</a>), and took note of anything which tickled my fancy.</p>

<p>First of all, <a title="Sakerock on YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sakerock&amp;oq=sakerock&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..0.1401l3626l0l3750l12l12l1l0l0l0l301l1185l4j6j0j1l11l0.">Sakerock</a> blew me away. I could not stop listening to Kaishain (see video below). The rest of the album is excellent, too (but unfortunately not on Spotify).</p>

<p>I also discovered Cornelius, whose album, <a title="Point on Spotify" href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5lSdPoQZHkcLVsUZPUKFTD">Point</a>, is brilliant.</p>

<p>I&apos;ve put together <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/bonanza9/playlist/6yygRikWBgZ65CWonmHa57">a Spotify playlist of this month&apos;s Japanese music</a>, which also includes Sakura by Susumu Yokota. Enjoy!</p>
