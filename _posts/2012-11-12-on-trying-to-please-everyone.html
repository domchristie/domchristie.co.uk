<blockquote>
<p>When you broadly and arbitrarily extend a product&apos;s functionality to include many constituencies, you increase the cognitive load and overhead for all users.</p>
<p>&#x2026; If you try to design  an automobile that pleases every possible driver, you end up with a car with every possible feature, but pleases nobody. Software today is too often designed to please too many users, resulting in low satisfaction.</p>
