<p>I&apos;m a big fan of what Yehuda Katz and Tom Dale are doing in their approach to creating <a href="http://emberjs.com/">ember.js</a> (formely SproutCore 2.0). The background to this approach is discussed in Yehuda&apos;s TXJS 2011 talk (below), which is well worth a watch.</p>

<p>In addition to arguing the case for going beyond microframeworks, Yehuda also talks about native vs. web UI design:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People quickly expect &quot;application&quot; when you start adding features like transitions &#x2026; When you build a UI for the web, you need to either make it very distinctively different from [native] applications: make it very much feel like the web; or you need to get it right. If you get it half way, it feels wrong. If you don&apos;t want to go the whole way, don&apos;t do transitions at all.</p>
  <cite>Yehuda Katz in his TXJS 2011 talk (below) at ~32:30</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>It&apos;s fascinating that people&apos;s expectations&#x2014;and therefore the software&apos;s context&#x2014;can be altered so easily, with something as simple as an animation.</p>
