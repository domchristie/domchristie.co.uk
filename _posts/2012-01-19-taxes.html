<p>I&apos;ve been meaning to get this quotation down for ages. I heard it on Radio 4&apos;s Chain Reaction programme back in September last year, when Kevin Eldon interviewed Mark Steel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think lampposts soon will have little meters on, and you&apos;ll put 5p in and it&apos;ll give you just enough light to get to the next one: &quot;Why should I pay for someone else&apos;s light? I&apos;M INDOORS!&#x2026; bloody fire-brigade &#x2014; I&apos;m not on fire! I&apos;ll pay when I want carrying over someones shoulder down a smoky bannister!&quot;</p>

<p>These are the sort of people that go: &quot;What about guide dogs? All the money that gets spent on them! I can&apos;t climb a tree, nobody buys me a gibbon!&quot;</p>
