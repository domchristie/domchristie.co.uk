<p>I don&apos;t plan on writing much about neuroscience(!), but the following quotation caught my ear. It comes from BBC Radio 4&apos;s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015sqc7"> The Life Scientific</a> &#x2013; a series of interviews with scientists about their life and work.</p>
<p>It&apos;s not a programme I&apos;d usually seek out &#x2013; it just happens to be on after the Today programme, but every episode I&apos;ve heard has been really interesting, and has got me thinking.</p>

<blockquote><p>Neuroscience calls itself a science (obviously), but it&apos;s very different from [a physicist&apos;s] science of physics, or a chemist&apos;s science of chemistry, because it&apos;s a set of techniques searching for a common answer, rather than a real structured level of analysis of a scientific problem.</p><p>... in physics, the questions are agreed. You could walk into any physicist&apos;s office or lab, and say, &quot;What are the big questions in physics?&quot;, and they&apos;d reel them off: &quot;How did the universe start?&quot;, &quot;What&apos;s matter made of?&quot;; and everyone would agree. But if you ask that question to a neuroscientist, they&apos;d just be puzzled by the question.</p><cite>Neuroscientist Colin Blakemore, on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b016wxtx/The_Life_Scientific_Episode_5/">The Life Scientific</a></cite></blockquote>
