<blockquote><p>If you can understand the ordinary, the simple things in life, the mind can be opened to foster harmony in humanity, promote harmony with nature, discipline the mind, and quiet the heart. This in turn affects our output as human beings.</p><cite><a href="http://the189.com/photography/simple-things-by-isabelle-bertolini/">Mark Robinson</a></cite></blockquote>
