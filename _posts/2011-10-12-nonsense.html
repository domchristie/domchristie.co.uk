<blockquote>
  <p>Talking nonsense the sole privilege mankind possesses over the other organisms. It&apos;s by talking nonsense that one gets to the truth! I talk nonsense, therefore I am human. Not one single truth has ever been arrived at without people first having talked a dozen reams of nonsense, even ten dozen reams of it, and that&apos;s an honourable thing in its own way; well, but we can&apos;t even talk nonsense with our own brains! Talk nonsense to me, by all means, but do it with your own brain, and I shall love you for it. To talk nonsense in one&apos;s own way is almost better than to talk a truth that&apos;s someone else&apos;s; in the first instance you behave like a human being, while in the second you are merely being a parrot!</p>
